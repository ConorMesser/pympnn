NEEDED INTERFACE
MultiANN(dim, maxNeighbors, topology, scale)
 - AddPoint(point's coordinates, pointer to the point - must not be deleted?)
 - NearestNeighbor(query_pt, index(returned), best distance(returned)
 - NearestNeighbor(query_pt, array of distances(returned), array of indices - int (returned), array of pointers to NNs(returned)

need way to check neighbors within certain distance (shouldn't be too hard to add to c++ code??)

(single NearestNeighbor)
 - const double* &  :  reference to pointer to constant double (ANNpoint)
 - int &            :  reference to int
 - double &         :  reference to double

(k NN)
 - const double* &  :  reference to pointer to constant double (ANNpoint)
 - double* &        :  reference to pointer to double (array of ANNpoint)
 - int *&           :  reference to pointer to int (array of int)
 - void **&         :  reference to pointer to pointer to void (array of pointers)


(AddPoint)
 - double*          :  pointer to double (ANNpoint)
 - void *           :  pointer to void


INITIALIZATION
 - int              :  int (dimension of space)
 - int              :  int (k - num of NN to be returned)
 - int*             :  pointer to int (array of int - topologies)
 - double*          :  pointer to double (ANNpoint)
